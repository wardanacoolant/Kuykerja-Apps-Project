# Kuykerja Apps Project

This is a repository related to the Performance Application Development project, which in this case is still within the scope of interface design, as well as user experience design.

## Background

Seeing the development of mobile technology at this time, it is deemed necessary to develop an application version of the daily job search portal in Bali, Kuykerja. A good application is certainly built on the basis of the needs of its users. On this basis, this project was created to meet the needs of users, while directing and providing an overview to application developers. With limited resources and time, we are challenged to find solutions to provide the best for our users.

## Aim

As a basis for creating a Kuykerja mobile-based application, so that users get new experience in applying for daily job vacancies in Bali.

## Benefits

As part of the Kuykerja application project, the project is expected to provide an overview of the application interface that will be created.
